# Railcar-Capacity-Calculator

As the train master for a local railway, your job is to determine and report how many automobiles can be shipped on your train
from London, Ontario to Ottawa, Ontario. There are different sizes of railcars, capable of carrying automobiles, in quantities
between 36 and 48 automobiles. You will determine how many railcars, of a particular size, are needed to transport a shipment
of automobiles that have arrived at your railyard. Ideally, it is preferable to have an appropriate number of railcars available to
meet the needs of your customer, but that is not always the case.
Write a Java program that will calculate the minimum number of railcars required to do this as well as the numbers of
automobiles that can be shipped given the number of available railcars. Your program should be flexible enough to work for any
railway company, any number of automobiles, and any size of railcar
